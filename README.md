# simonSays

 The goal here is to create Simon Says with no guide or direction. <br>
 I want to structure this with no ejs, a server, and mostly a state change based app with JavaScript. <br>
 The server will mostly be just loading the main page, but we will incorporate SQL for users and high score.

 Basic scaffolding, plus notes of how I think the process should go between front end and server.
